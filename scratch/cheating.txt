What is Cheating?
Cheating is perhaps the oldest form of academic dishonesty. According to the Student Code of Conduct:
"Cheating constitutes behavior that uses or attempts to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise that would result in an unfair advantage over fellow students in an academic exercise." (Student Code of Conduct)
Research suggests that a large percentage of students have and will cheat under certain circumstances. But unlike plagiarism, which can happen out of ignorance (you will learn about this in Module 2), cheating more often than not is an intentional act of academic dishonesty.
There are probably a million ways that students cheat but a few examples are:
●	Unauthorized copying of class assignments - such as examinations - before, during, or after the assignment, either for your own use or for the use of others.
●	Depending on or providing the aid of sources not authorized by the faculty member in preparing for exams, writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments
●	Acquiring any assignment or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff without permission from the instructor of the course
●	Creating, keeping, or using unauthorized collections of assignments
●	Having someone else complete a class assignment or attend a class in your place
●	Completing a class assignment for someone else
●	Assisting others in acts of academic misconduct through the facilitation of behavior which would violate the Student Code of Conduct for academic misconduct (Student Code of Conduct)
●	(Student Code of Conduct)
In this module, we will go over the definition of cheating in more detail and discuss common ways that students cheat to help you get a better idea of how to avoid making the same mistakes.












Copying from Another's Test or Homework
As mentioned earlier, there are a number of ways students cheat. Studies suggest that the majority of students have cheated at some time in the past. Therefore, we are going to go over a few common ways to illustrate exactly how it's done and how you can avoid making this mistake. We are going to begin by focusing on copying from another's test or homework.
Imagine this Scenario
Frank wants to raise his GPA to improve his chances for getting into graduate school. He's finishing his last elective. While he isn't interested in the subject of the course, he really needs an "A". He spends hours studying for the final exam. In fact, he even reads the entire textbook a second time. During the test he finds his preparation is paying off. He is flying through the exam! But there's one question he isn't sure about. Actually, he is sure this material wasn't addressed in class or in the book. He thinks this question is unfair. He thinks the answer is either "b." or "c.". Unintentionally, he looks over at his neighbor's test and notices that he has answered "c". Based on this, he writes down "c." and turns in his test. Frank's teacher thought he saw Frank looking at his neighbor's test and writing down an answer.
What should Frank's instructor do?
Frank has been a good student all semester. He studied for the exam and didn't plan on copying an answer. But at the end of the day, he copied an answer from another person's exam, which is cheating.
●	What happens if Frank gets an "F" on the test?
●	What happens if Frank fails the class?
●	What if his instructor turns a blind eye?
As difficult as it might be, avoid looking anywhere near any of your classmates while completing an exam.




Unauthorized Assistance
Another way students often cheat is through the use of unauthorized assistance. This is when someone helps you when they shouldn't be or using materials you shouldn't be using. We will discuss both.
While there are instances where students have other people take entire exams or courses for them, often unauthorized assistance involves seeking help from a peer during an academic exercise like an exam. Years ago this type of cheating might simply involve whispering to a classmate sitting next to you. These days students find all kinds of ways to get assistance--everything from texting a friend during an exam to programming notes into a calculator and accessing online test bank questions. As a result, even the presence of a cell phone during an exam can alarm a faculty member. So be sure to leave your cell phone in your pocket on exam day! And keep in mind that any type of unauthorized assistance is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct.
A True Story
Paul sat down to take his exam. When nobody was looking, he pulled out his phone and took a picture of the exam. A few minutes later he told his instructor that he had to go to the bathroom because of some stomach problems he had been having. Out in the hall, he looked over the questions from the picture on his phone and called his roommate for help on the questions. He then went back into the class and repeated this one more time. In the end, Paul was caught because students in the hall found out what he was doing and told his instructor.




Unauthorized Assistance
But unauthorized assistance doesn't have to be as technologically sophisticated as previously described. For instance, it can simply involve having a cheat sheet (sometimes called a crib sheet).
Imagine this Scenario
Jane is the first person in her family to go to college. She feels a ton of pressure to earn high grades. Her final exam is Friday and she must get an "A" to maintain a 3.0 GPA. She spends all day Thursday creating a cheat sheet to use during the exam. To her surprise though, she found no need to use the cheat sheet during the exam. But as she left the exam, the cheat sheet fell out of her pocket right in front of her instructor. Jane's instructor confronts her about the cheat sheet. Jane explains that she planned to cheat but never actually used the cheat sheet.
What should Jane's instructor do?
She's torn. She wants to believe Jane, but, even if she does, the academic Student Code of Conduct clearly states that "Cheating constitutes behavior that uses or attempts to use ...study aids in any academic exercise that would result in an unfair advantage over fellow students in an academic exercise." (Student Code of Conduct)
As a result, Jane's instructor accuses her of violating the Student Code of Conduct. Jane is so worried that her parents will find out and realizes too late how serious the consequences of academic misconduct can be.




Unauthorized Assistance
Not all instances of using unauthorized assistance are as clear cut as the last few.
Imagine this Scenario
Ashley has a take-home final exam that is comprised of three essay questions. Her instructor tells her that she can use her textbook and notes on the exam. Ashley is very insecure about her writing ability. She always has her husband edit her work. After spending hours on her exam and feeling like all the main ideas were down on paper, she asks her husband to clean up her work and "make it sound pretty."
So did Ashley cheat?
Technically she did. While it might not seem as bad as many of the examples discussed thus far, she did receive unauthorized assistance from another on her exam, which is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. If you are ever unclear of what you can or can't do during an exam, simply ask your instructor before the exam or assignment in question.




Unauthorized Assistance
Unauthorized assistance isn't restricted to cheat sheets, people, or high tech gadgetry. It can even involve using a calculator when told that you can't or searching the web for answers while taking a quiz or test online. Some faculty use special software like the Respondus Lockdown Browser to limit your ability to open new web browser windows when taking a test or quiz on Blackboard.
The Respondus Lockdown Browser is a special piece of software that faculty can require in order to control the online test taking environment. The way it works is that you must download and install the Respondus Lockdown Browser on your computer. Then when it comes time to take the exam, you login to your course in Blackboard by using the Lockdown Browser instead of another browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox. The Lockdown Browser locks down your computer screen so that you are unable to access other Websites or print exams.




Collaborating with Others
Collaboration is most often a good thing. But collaborating with others on assignments or tests--unless specifically allowed by the instructor--is a form of cheating. Students do this in a number of ways. Inappropriate collaboration includes everything from telling a friend what questions are on a test to not covering up one's answers while taking a test. But regardless of how it's done, collaborating when not allowed for by the instructor is cheating. That's right, simply helping others cheat by providing answers to the test is considered a violation of the Student Code of Conduct.




So Why Does this Matter?
Research suggests that students cheat in part because they don't see it as being wrong. Further, culturally speaking, while we regularly claim that "cheaters never win," people both inside and outside of the university continue to cheat in an effort to get an advantage. From baseball players taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs to corporate executives skewing profit-and-loss statements, people regularly cheat.
But how would you feel if you were another baseball player who played fair, or a stockholder who is cheated by an unethical corporate executive? How do you feel when you work really hard on something and then find out that a peer simply cheated and got the same result?
Our University is committed to upholding our Shared Values--academic integrity is an important component of several of these values including Academic Excellence, Fairness and Trustworthiness.. But even if you don't believe in that, even if you don't think cheating is wrong, you at least should understand that cheating is against the rules and is considered a violation of the Student Code of Conduct at Boise State. If you cheat and you are caught, you will have be sanctioned by the University--these sanctions may range from receiving a written warning, to failing a course, all the way to suspension or expulsion.
So at the end of the day, even if you feel like you have no other option, cheating is never worth the risk. And if you cheat, you will eventually be caught.



Check to See What You Learned
1. If you are caught cheating, you will automatically get an "F" on the test.
●	 True
●	 False [Correct! While every school and college has their own guidelines on how to handle cases of academic dishonesty, it is ultimately up to the instructor how he or she handles it. Some instructors might simply ask you to redo the assignment while others will seek the highest sanction possible.]
2. You are taking a course with a few friends and your roommate. During an exam you notice that your roommate is looking over your shoulder at your paper. What should you do?
●	 a. Move your shoulder so that she can see all of your answers
●	 b. Tell her to stop looking at your test
●	 c. Try covering your answers so that she can't copy off of your test [Correct! The best thing to do would be to simply cover your answers because letting someone copy off of your test is an example of cheating. But avoid talking to her during the exam because that too could be seen as cheating.]
●	 d. Write down the wrong answers so that she copies incorrect answers
3. You have hired a tutor to help you succeed in your class.  You are working together on a homework assignment and as your tutor is explaining how to answer the question she is actually answering the questions for you.  Is this cheating?  How much help is too much?
•	It is not cheating as long as you actually write down the answer, the tutor is doing her job helping you solve the problem.
•	It is cheating because the answer is not being provided by you [Correct! Tutors can provide valuable support in attaining your educational goals, be sure to discuss concepts or questions similar to those in the homework to avoid cheating by allowing the tutor to answer the question for you.  Homework is a way to prepare for tests and if your tutor answers your questions for you, you will be unlikely to do well on future exams.]
4. Your older brother recently started taking classes again after taking two years off. He plans to take the same courses as you so that he can save some money and use your textbooks. He asks you to keep a copy of the final exam for him to study next semester. This isn't cheating though because you are simply keeping a copy of an exam that you had to take and he plans to just use it as a study guide.
●	 True
●	 False [Correct! This actually is cheating. Unless your instructor specifically states that you can keep a copy of the exam, you should assume that your instructors do not want you to keep, print, or distribute copies of their exams to anyone under any circumstance. Further, instructors often use some of the same questions on future exams so this is essentially giving another unauthorized assistance on an exam which is cheating.]
5. Shelly and John live close to each other. They are taking a lot of the same courses online. They often study together before their exams. They decided to meet up and take the next exam at the same time together. During the exam, John turns to Shelly and asks where in their book question 6 is addressed. Shelly tells him to look at chapter 3. Even though Shelly didn't tell John the answer to the question, they both cheated and violated the Student Code of Conduct.
●	 True [Correct! Even though Shelly and John are taking their courses online, you can assume that their instructor does not want them taking the exam at the same time right next to each other. Further, even though Shelly didn't tell John the answer, telling him where to find the answer is an example of unauthorized assistance. Finally, it is possible they shouldn't have been using their book to begin with during the exam.]
●	 False
