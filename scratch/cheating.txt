Now that we know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it, let's focus on perhaps the oldest form of academic dishonesty—cheating. According to the University Catalog:

"Cheating involves the possession, communication or use of information, materials, notes, study aids or other devices not authorized by the instructor in any academic exercise or communication with another person during such an exercise." (University Catalog)

[tabgroup]
[tab title="Intro" id="1"]Research suggests that a large percentage of students have and will cheat under certain circumstances. But unlike plagiarism, which can happen out of ignorance (as touched on in Module 1), cheating more often than not is an intentional act of academic dishonesty.

95% of high school students report they have cheated. School Library Journal 2008

There are probably a million ways that students cheat but a few examples are:

copying from another’s paper
receiving unauthorized assistance from someone with an exercise or the submission of an assignment
using a calculator when its use is not allowed
collaborating with another student or students during an academic exercise without the consent of the instructor. (University Catalog)
In this module, we will go over the definition of cheating in more detail and discuss common ways that students cheat to help you get a better idea of how to avoid making the same mistakes. While this module is shorter than the last, don't assume that cheating is any less important than plagiarism.[/tab]
[tab title="Definition" id="2"]
Let's look closely at the definition of cheating. There are basically two parts.

Part 1

"Cheating involves the possession, communication or use of information, materials, notes, study aids or other devices not authorized by the instructor in any academic exercise..."

The first part states that cheating involves possessing, communicating, or using stuff not authorized by your instructor in any academic exercise. While "possessing," "communicating," or "using" unauthorized stuff during an exam are three different types of behavior, they are all considered cheating.

That means, having the answer key to a quiz or passing it along to a fellow student is cheating, whether you use it or not! Another thing to note is that cheating isn't only about tests and quizzes. It includes any academic exercise.

Part 2

"... communication with another person during such an [academic] exercise"
This is important because it states that communicating in any way with another person (whether or not about the academic exercise in progress or not) is considered cheating. So be sure never to talk with your fellow classmates during an exam or any other academic exercise in which it is prohibited. If you ever aren't sure, ask your instructor.

Copying from Another's Paper

[notice title="Imagine this Scenario" color="yellow"]Frank wants to raise his GPA to improve his chances for getting into graduate school. He's finishing his last elective. While he isn't interested in the subject of the course, he really needs an "A". He spends hours studying for the final exam. In fact, he even reads the entire textbook a second time. During the test he finds his preparation is paying off. He is flying through the exam! But there's one question he isn't sure about. Actually, he is sure this material wasn't addressed in class or in the book. He thinks this question is unfair. He think's the answer is either "b." or "c.". Unintentionally, he looks over at his neighbor's test and notices that he has answered "c". Based on this, he writes down "c." and turns in his test. Frank's teacher though saw Frank looking at his neighbor's test and writing down an answer.

What should Frank's instructor do?

Frank has been a good student all semester. He studied for the exam and didn't plan on copying an answer. But at the end of the day, he copied an answer from another person's exam, which is cheating.

What happens if Frank gets an "F" on the test?
What happens if Frank fails the class?
What if his instructor turns a blind eye?
[/notice]
As difficult as it might be, avoid looking anywhere near any of your classmates while completing an exam.

Unauthorized Assistance 1/4

Another way students often cheat is through unauthorized assistance. This is when someone helps you when they shouldn't be or using materials you shouldn't be using. We will discuss both.

While there are instances where students have other people take entire exams for them, often this type of cheating simply involves seeking help from a peer during an academic exercise like an exam. Years ago this type of cheating might simply involve whispering to a classmate sitting next to you. These days students find all kinds of ways to get assistance--everything from texting a friend during an exam to using high-end ear pieces and other devices. As a result, even the presence of a cell phone during an exam can alarm a faculty member. So be sure to leave your cell phone in your pocket on exam day! And keep in mind that any type of unauthorized assistance is a violation of the academic honor code.
[notice title="A True Story"]
Paul sat down to take his exam. When nobody was looking, he pulled out his phone and took a picture of the exam. A few minutes later he told his instructor that he had to go to the bathroom because of some stomach problems he has been having. Out in the hall, he looked over the questions from the picture on his phone and called his roommate for help on the questions. He then went back into the class and repeated this one more time. In the end, Paul was caught because students in the hall found out what he was doing and told his instructor.[/notice][/tab]
[tab title="Cheat Sheet" id="5"]

Unauthorized Assistance 2/4

But unauthorized assistance doesn't have to be as technologically sophisticated as previously described. For instance, it can simply involve having a cheat sheet (sometimes called a crib sheet).

[notice title="Imagine this Scenario" color="yellow"]Jane is the first person in her family to go to college. She feels a ton of pressure to earn high grades. Her final exam is Friday and she must get an "A" to maintain a 3.0 GPA. She spends all day Thursday creating a cheat sheet to use during the exam. To her surprise though, she found no need to use the cheat sheet during the exam. But as she left the exam, the cheat sheet fell out of her pocket right in front of her instructor. Jane's instructor confronts her about the cheat sheet. Jane explains that she planned to cheat but never actually used the cheat sheet.

What should Jane's instructor do?

She's torn. She wants to believe Jane, but, even if she does, the Student Code of Conduct clearly states that "Cheating constitutes behavior that uses or attempts to use …study aids in any academic exercise that would result in an unfair advantage over fellow students in an academic exercise." (University Catalog)

As a result, Jane's instructor accuses her of violating the academic honor code. Jane is so worried that her parents will find out and realizes too late that there is more at stake in academic dishonesty than GPA.[/notice]

Unauthorized Assistance 3/4

Not all instances of using unauthorized assistance are as clear cut as the last few.

[notice title="Imagine this Scenario" color="yellow"]Ashley has a take-home final exam that is comprised of three essay questions. Her instructor tells her that she can use her textbook and notes on the exam. Ashley is very insecure about her writing ability. She always has her husband edit her work. After spending hours on her exam and feeling like all the main ideas were down on paper, she asks her husband to clean up her work and "make it sound pretty."

So did Ashley cheat?

Technically she did. While it might not seem as bad as many of the examples discussed thus far, she did receive unauthorized assistance from another on her exam, which is a violation of the honor code. If you are ever unclear of what you can or can't do during an exam, simply ask your instructor before the exam or assignment in question.[/notice]

[tab title="Technology" id="7"]

Unauthorized Assistance 4/4

Unauthorized assistance isn't restricted to cheat sheets, people, or high tech gadgetry. It can even involve using a calculator when told that you can't or searching the web for answers while taking a quiz or test online. Some faculty use special software like the Respondus Lockdown Browser to limit your ability to open new web browser windows when taking a test or quiz in Blackboard.

The Respondus Lockdown Browser is a special piece of software that faculty can require in order to control the online test taking environment. The way it works is that you must download and install the Respondus Lockdown Browser on your computer. Then when it comes time to take the exam, you login to your course in Blackboard by using the Lockdown Browser instead of another browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox. The Lockdown Browser locks down your computer screen so that you are unable to access other Websites or print exams.

[tab title="Collaboration" id="8"]

Collaborating with Others

Collaboration is most often a good thing. But collaborating with others--unless specifically allowed by the instructor--is a form of cheating. Students do this in a number of ways. Inappropriate collaboration includes everything from telling a friend what questions are on a test to not covering up one's answers while taking a test. But regardless of how it's done, collaborating when not allowed for by the instructor is cheating. That's right, simply helping others cheat by providing answers to the test is considered a violation of the academic honor code.[/tab]
[tab title="Importance" id="9"]

So Why Does this Matter?

Research suggests that students cheat in part because they don't see it as being wrong. Further, culturally speaking, while we regularly claim that "cheaters never win," people both inside and outside of the university continue to cheat in an effort to get an advantage. From baseball players taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs to corporate executives skewing profit-and-loss statements, people regularly cheat.

But how would you feel if you were another baseball player who played fair, or a stockholder who is cheated by an unethical corporate executive? How do you feel when you work really hard on something and then find out that a peer simply cheated and got the same result?

Our University wants to instill academic honesty and integrity of character in all of our students. But even if you don't believe in that, even if you don't think cheating is wrong, you at least should understand that cheating is against the rules and is considered a violation of the academic honor code at UCD. If you cheat and you are caught, you will have to suffer the consequences--anything from getting a zero on an assignment or a failing grade in the course, all the way to suspension or even expulsion.

So at the end of the day, even if you feel like you have no other option, cheating is never worth the risk. And if you cheat, you will eventually be caught.

Check to See What You Learned

1. Cheating is worse than plagiarism.

[toggle title="True"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="False"]Correct! Cheating and plagiarism are both violations of the academic honor code and examples of academic dishonesty that can result in being expelled from UCD.[/toggle]

2. If you are caught cheating, you will automatically get an "F" on the test.

[toggle title="True"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="False"]Correct! While every school and college has their own guidelines on how to handle cases of academic dishonesty, it is ultimately up to the instructor how he or she handles it. Some instructors might simply ask you to redo the assignment while others will seek the highest punishment possible.[/toggle]

3. You are taking a course with a few friends and your roommate. During an exam you notice that your roommate is looking over your shoulder at your paper. What should you do?

[toggle title="a. Move your shoulder so that she can see all of your answers"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="b. Tell her to stop looking at your test"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="c. Try covering your answers so that she can't copy off of your test"]Correct! The best thing to do would be to simply cover your answers because letting someone copy off of your test is an example of cheating. But avoid talking to her during the exam because that too could be seen as cheating.[/toggle]
[toggle title="d. Write down the wrong answers so that she copies incorrect answers"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]

4. Your older brother recently started taking classes again after taking two years off. He plans to take the same courses as you so that he can save some money and use your textbooks. He asks you to keep a copy of the final exam for him to study next semester. This isn't cheating though because you are simply keeping a copy of an exam that you had to take and he plans to just use it as a study guide.

[toggle title="True"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="False"]Correct! This actually is cheating. Unless your instructor specifically states that you can keep a copy of the exam, you should assume that your instructors do not want you to keep, print, or distribute copies of their exams to anyone under any circumstance. Further, instructors often use some of the same questions on future exams so this is essentially giving another unauthorized assistance on an exam which is cheating.[/toggle]

4. Matt found a great quote on a Wikipedia for a paper he is writing. He wants to add it to his paper but he isn't sure how to cite it. What should he do?

[toggle title="a. Not worry about the citation because his teacher didn't specify that he needed to cite everything"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="b. Don't use the quote in his paper"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="c. Rewrite the quote in his own words and not worry about the citation"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="d. Ask his teacher how to cite it"]Incorrect. Please try again.[/toggle]
[toggle title="e. B or D"]Correct! Matt could simply avoid the problem of how to properly cite the quote by not using it but in the long run he is better knowing how to cite a quote from a source like Wikipedia and should turn to his instructor for help.[/toggle]

5. Shelly and John live close to each other. They are taking a lot of the same courses online. They often study together before their exams. They decided to meet up and take the next exam at the same time together. During the exam, John turns to Shelly and asks where in their book question 6 is addressed. Shelly tells him to look at chapter 3. Even though Shelly didn't tell John the answer to the question, they both cheated and violated the academic honor code.

[toggle title="True"]Correct! Even though Shelly and John are taking their
courses online, you can assume that their instructor does not want them taking
the exam at the same time right next to each other. Further, even though Shelly
didn't tell John the answer, telling him where to find the answer is an example
of unauthorized assistance. Finally, it is possible they shouldn't have been
using their book to begin with during the exam.[/toggle] [toggle
