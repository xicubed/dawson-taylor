<body>  one near Seattle on her way to work,Tanya Rider went off the road and crashed into a ravine.* For eight days, shewas trapped upside down in the wreckage of her car. Severely dehydrated andsuffering from injuries to her leg and shoulder, she nearly died of kidney fail-ure. Fortunately, rescuers ultimately found her. She spent months recuperat-ing in a medical facility. Happily, she was able to go home for Christmas. Tanya’s story is not just about a woman, an accident, and a rescue. It is astory about bits—the zeroes and ones that make up all our cell phone conver-sations, bank records, and everything else that gets communicated or storedusing modern electronics.Tanya was found because cell phone companies keep records of cell phonelocations. When you carry your cell phone, it regularly sends out a digital“ping,” a few bits conveying a “Here I am!” message. Your phone keeps “ping-ing” as long as it remains turned on. Nearby cell phone towers pick up thepings and send them on to your cellular service provider. Your cell phonecompany uses the pings to direct your incoming calls to the right cell phonetowers. Tanya’s cell phone company, Verizon, still had a record of the lastlocation of her cell phone, even after the phone had gone dead. That is howthe police found her. So why did it take more than a week? If a woman disappears, her husband can’t just make the police find her bytracing her cell phone records. She has a privacy right, and maybe she hasgood reason to leave town without telling her husband where she is going. In1* Citations of facts and sources appear at the end of the book.

Tanya’s case, her bank account showed some activity (more bits!) after herdisappearance, and the police could not classify her as a “missing person.” Infact, that activity was by her husband. Through some misunderstanding, thepolice thought he did not have access to the account. Only when the policesuspected Tanya’s husband of involvement in her disappearance did theyhave legal access to the cell phone records. Had they continued to act on thetrue presumption that he was blameless, Tanya might never have been found. New technologies interacted in an odd way with evolving standards of pri-vacy, telecommunications, and criminal law. The explosive combinationalmost cost Tanya Rider her life. Her story is dramatic, but every day weencounter unexpected consequences of data flows that could not have hap-pened a few years ago. When you have finished reading this book, you should see the world in adifferent way. You should hear a story from a friend or on a newscast and sayto yourself, “that’s really a bits story,” even if no one mentions anything dig-ital. The movements of physical objects and the actions of flesh and bloodhuman beings are only the surface. To understand what is really going on, youhave to see the virtual world, the eerie flow of bits steering the events of life. This book is your guide to this new world. The Explosion of Bits, and Everything Else The world changed very suddenly. Almost everything is stored in a computersomewhere. Court records, grocery purchases, precious family photos, point-less radio programs.... Computers contain a lot of stuff that isn’t useful todaybut somebody thinks might someday come in handy. It is all being reducedto zeroes and ones—“bits.” The bits are stashed on disks of home computersand in the data centers of big corporations and government agencies. Thedisks can hold so many bits that there is no need to pick and choose whatgets remembered. So much digital information, misinformation, data, and garbage is beingsquirreled away that most of it will be seen only by computers, never byhuman eyes. And computers are getting better and better at extracting mean-ing from all those bits—finding patterns that sometimes solve crimes andmake useful suggestions, and sometimes reveal things about us we did notexpect others to know. The March 2008 resignation of Eliot Spitzer as Governor of New York is abits story as well as a prostitution story. Under anti-money laundering (AML)rules, banks must report transactions of more than $10,000 to federal regula-tors. None of Spitzer’s alleged payments reached that threshold, but his2BLOWN  TO  BITS01_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 2
bank’s computer found that transfers of smaller sums formed a suspiciouspattern. The AML rules exist to fight terrorism and organized crime. But whilethe computer was monitoring small banking transactions in search ofbig-time crimes, it exposed a simple payment for services rendered thatbrought down the Governor.Once something is on a computer, it can replicate and move around theworld in a heartbeat. Making a million perfect copies takes but an instant—copies of things we want everyone in the world to see, and also copies ofthings that weren’t meant to be copied at all. The digital explosion is changing the world as much as printing once did—and some of the changes are catching us unaware, blowing to bits ourassumptions about the way the world works. When we observe the digital explosion at all, it can seem benign, amus-ing, or even utopian. Instead of sending prints through the mail to Grandma,we put pictures of our children on a photo album web site such as Flickr. Thennot only can Grandma see them—so can Grandma’s friends and anyone else.So what? They are cute and harmless. But suppose a tourist takes a vacationsnapshot and you just happen to appear in the background, at a restaurantwhere no one knew you were dining. If the tourist uploads his photo, thewhole world could know where you were, and when you were there. Data leaks. Credit card records are supposed to stay locked up in a datawarehouse, but escape into the hands of identity thieves. And we sometimesgive information away just because we get something back for doing so. Acompany will give you free phone calls to anywhere in the world—if youdon’t mind watching ads for the products its computers hear you talkingabout.And those are merely things that are happening today. The explosion, andthe social disruption it will create, have barely begun. We already live in a world in which there is enough memory just in digi-tal camerasto store every word of every book in the Library of Congress ahundred times over. So much email is being sent that it could transmit thefull text of the Library of Congress in ten minutes. Digitized pictures andsounds take more space than words, so emailing all the images, movies, andsounds might take a year—but that is just today. The explosive growth is stillhappening. Every year we can store more information, move it more quickly,and do far more ingenious things with it than we could the year before. So much disk storage is being produced every year that it could be used torecord a page of information, every minute or two, about you and every otherhuman being on earth. A remark made long ago can come back to haunt apolitical candidate, and a letter jotted quickly can be a key discovery for aCHAPTER1DIGITAL EXPLOSION301_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 3
biographer. Imagine what it would mean to record every word every humanbeing speaks or writes in a lifetime. The technological barrier to that hasalready been removed: There is enough storage to remember it all. Shouldany social barrier stand in the way?Sometimes things seem to work both better and worse than they used to.A “public record” is now very public—before you get hired in Nashville,Tennessee, your employer can figure out if you were caught ten years agotaking an illegal left turn in Lubbock, Texas. The old notion of a “sealed courtrecord” is mostly a fantasy in a world where any tidbit of information isduplicated, cataloged, and moved around endlessly. With hundreds of TV andradio stations and millions of web sites, Americans love the variety of newssources, but are still adjusting uncomfortably to the displacement of moreauthoritative sources. In China, the situation is reversed: The technology cre-ates greater government control of the information its citizens receive, andbetter tools for monitoring their behavior. This book is about how the digital explosion is changing everything. Itexplains the technology itself—why it creates so many surprises and whythings often don’t work the way we expect them to. It is also about things theinformation explosion is destroying: old assumptions about our privacy,about our identity, and about who is in control of our lives. It’s about howwe got this way, what we are losing, and what remains that society still hasa chance to put right. The digital explosion is creating both opportunities andrisks. Many of both will be gone in a decade, settled one way or another.Governments, corporations, and other authorities are taking advantage of thechaos, and most of us don’t even see it happening. Yet we all have a stake inthe outcome. Beyond the science, the history, the law, and the politics, thisbook is a wake-up call. The forces shaping your future are digital, and youneed to understand them. The Koans of Bits Bits behave strangely. They travel almost instantaneously, and they takealmost no space to store. We have to use physical metaphors to make themunderstandable. We liken them to dynamite exploding or water flowing. Weeven use social metaphors for bits. We talk about two computers agreeing onsome bits, and about people using burglary tools to steal bits. Getting the rightmetaphor is important, but so is knowing the limitations of our metaphors. Animperfect metaphor can mislead as much as an apt metaphor can illuminate. 4BLOWN  TO  BITS01_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 4
We offer seven truths about bits. We call them “koans” because they areparadoxes, like the Zen verbal puzzles that provoke meditation and enlight-enment. These koans are oversimplifications and over-generalizations. Theydescribe a world that is developing but hasn’t yet fully emerged. But eventoday they are truer than we often realize. These themes will echo throughour tales of the digital explosion.Koan 1: It’s All Just BitsYour computer successfully creates the illusion that it contains photographs,letters, songs, and movies. All it really contains is bits, lots of them, patternedin ways you can’t see. Your computer was designed to store just bits—all thefiles and folders and different kinds of data are illusions created by computerprogrammers. When you send an email containing a photograph, the com-puters that handle your message as it flows through the Internet have no ideathat what they are handling is part text and part graphic. Telephone calls arealso just bits, and that has helped create competition—traditional phone com-panies, cell phone companies, cable TV companies, and Voice over IP (VoIP)service providers can just shuffle bits around to each other to complete calls.The Internet was designed to handle just bits, not emails or attachments,which are inventions of software engineers. We couldn’t live without thosemore intuitive concepts, but they are artifices. Underneath, it’s all just bits. This koan is more consequential than you might think. Consider the storyof Naral Pro-Choice America and Verizon Wireless. Naral wanted to form aCHAPTER1DIGITAL EXPLOSION5CLAUDESHANNONClaude Shannon (1916–2001) is the undis-puted founding figure of information andcommunication theory. While working at BellTelephone Laboratories after the SecondWorld War, he wrote the seminal paper, “Amathematical theory of communication,”which foreshadowed much of the subsequentdevelopment of digital technologies.Published in 1948, this paper gave birth tothe now-universal realization that the bit isthe natural unit of information, and to theuse of the term.Alcatel-Lucent, http:www.bell-labs.com/news/2001/february/26/shannon2_lg.jpeg.01_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 5
text messaging group to send alerts to its members. Verizon decided not toallow it, citing the “controversial or unsavory” things the messages mightcontain. Text message alert groups for political candidates it would allow, butnot for political causes it deemed controversial. Had Naral simply wantedtelephone service or an 800 number, Verizon would have had no choice.Telephone companies were long ago declared “common carriers.” Like rail-roads, phone companies are legally prohibited from picking and choosingcustomers from among those who want their services. In the bits world, thereis no difference between a text message and a wireless phone call. It’s all justbits, traveling through the air by radio waves. But the law hasn’t caught upto the technology. It doesn’t treat all bits the same, and the common carriagerules for voice bits don’t apply to text message bits. Verizon backed down in the caseof Naral, but not on the principle. Aphone company can do whatever itthinks will maximize its profits indeciding whose messages to distrib-ute. Yet no sensible engineering dis-tinction can be drawn between textmessages, phone calls, and any otherbits traveling through the digital air-waves. Koan 2: PerfectionIs Normal To err is human. When books werelaboriously transcribed by hand, inancient scriptoria and medievalmonasteries, errors crept in withevery copy. Computers and networkswork differently. Every copy is per-fect. If you email a photograph to afriend, the friend won’t receive afuzzier version than the original. Thecopy will be identical, down to thelevel of details too small for the eyeto see. Computers do fail, of course.Networks break down too. If the6BLOWN  TO  BITSEXCLUSIVE ANDRIVALROUSEconomists would say that bits,unless controlled somehow, tend tobe non-exclusive(once a few peo-ple have them, it is hard to keepthem from others) and non-rivalrous(when someone gets themfrom me, I don’t have any less). In aletter he wrote about the nature ofideas, Thomas Jefferson eloquentlystated both properties. If naturehas made any one thing less sus-ceptible than all others of exclu-sive property, it is the action of thethinking power called an idea,which an individual may exclu-sively possess as long as he keepsit to himself; but the moment it isdivulged, it forces itself into thepossession of every one, and thereceiver cannot dispossess himselfof it. Its peculiar character, too, isthat no one possesses the less,because every other possesses thewhole of it.01_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 6
power goes out, nothing works at all. So the statement that copies are nor-mally perfect is only relatively true. Digital copies are perfect only to theextent that they can be communicated at all. And yes, it is possible in theorythat a single bit of a big message will arrive incorrectly. But networks don’tjust pass bits from one place to another. They check to see if the bits seem tohave been damaged in transit, and correct them or retransmit them if theyseem incorrect. As a result of these error detection and correction mecha-nisms, the odds of an actual error—a character being wrong in an email, forexample—are so low that we would be wiser to worry instead about a meteorhitting our computer, improbable though precision meteor strikes may be. The phenomenon of perfect copies has drastically changed the law, a storytold in Chapter 6, “Balance Toppled.” In the days when music was distributedon audio tape, teenagers were not prosecuted for making copies of songs,because the copies weren’t as good as the originals, and copies of copieswould be even worse. The reason that thousands of people are today receiv-ing threats from the music and movie industries is that their copies are per-fect—not just as good as the original, but identical to the original, so thateven the notion of “original” is meaningless. The dislocations caused by filesharing are not over yet. The buzzword of the day is “intellectual property.”But bits are an odd kind of property. Once I release them, everybody hasthem. And if I give you my bits, I don’t have any fewer. Koan 3: There Is Want in the Midst of PlentyVast as world-wide data storage is today, five years from now it will be tentimes as large. Yet the information explosion means, paradoxically, the lossof information that is not online. One of us recently saw a new doctor at aclinic he had been using for decades. She showed him dense charts of hisblood chemistry, data transferred from his home medical device to the clinic’scomputer—more data than any specialist could have had at her disposal fiveyears ago. The doctor then asked whether he had ever had a stress test andwhat the test had shown. Those records should be all there, the patientexplained, in the medical file. But it was in the paper file, to which the doc-tor did not have access. It wasn’t in the computer’s memory, and the patient’smemory was being used as a poor substitute. The old data might as well nothave existed at all, since it wasn’t digital. Even information that exists in digital form is useless if there are nodevices to read it. The rapid progress of storage engineering has meant thatdata stored on obsolete devices effectively ceases to exist. In Chapter 3,“Ghosts in the Machine,” we shall see how a twentieth-century update of theCHAPTER1DIGITAL EXPLOSION701_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 7
population. At what point was it only a half as devastating? The answer isnot“a week and a half.” The answer is on the next to last day. Suppose it tooka week to develop and administer a vaccine. Then noticing the epidemic aftera week and a half would have left ample time to prevent the disaster. But thatwould have required understanding that there wasan epidemic when only2,000 people out of ten million were infected. The information story is full of examples of unperceived changes followedby dislocating explosions. Those with the foresight to notice the explosionjust a little earlier than everyone else can reap huge benefits. Those who movea little too slowly may be overwhelmed by the time they try to respond. Takethe case of digital photography. In 1983, Christmas shoppers could buy digital cameras to hook up to theirIBM PC and Apple II home computers. The potential was there for anyone tosee; it was not hidden in secret corporate laboratories. But digital photogra-phy did not take off. Economically and practically, it couldn’t. Cameras weretoo bulky to put in your pocket, and digital memories were too small to holdmany images. Even 14 years later, film photography was still a robust indus-try. In early 1997, Kodak stock hit a record price, with a 22% increase inquarterly profit, “fueled by healthy film and paper sales...[and] its motion pic-ture film business,” according to a news report. The company raised its divi-dend for the first time in eight years. But by 2007, digital memories hadbecome huge, digital processors had become fast and compact, and both werecheap. As a result, cameras had become little computers. The company thatwas once synonymous with photography was a shadow of its former self.Kodak announced that its employee force would be cut to 30,000, barely afifth the size it was during the good times of the late 1980s. The move wouldcost the company more than $3 billion. Moore’s Law moved faster thanKodak did. In the rapidly changing world of bits, it pays to notice even small changes,and to do something about them. Koan 6: Nothing Goes Away 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. That  is the number of bits that were created and stored away in 2007,according to one industry estimate. The capacity of disks has followed its ownversion of Moore’s Law, doubling every two or three years. For the time beingat least, that makes it possible to save everything though recent projectionssuggest that by 2011, we may be producing more bits than we can store. 10BLOWN  TO  BITS01_0137135599_ch01.qxd  4/16/08  1:19 PM  Page 10
